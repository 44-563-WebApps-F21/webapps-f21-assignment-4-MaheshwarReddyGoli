    <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2>

    <h3>FIRST ACT </h3>

    <h4>octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_. [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_. _At the top of the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_, _about twenty-seven years of age_. _She receives
        the guests as they come up_. _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by Boucher—that is stretched on
        the staircase wall_. _On the right is the entrance to the music-room_. _The sound of a string quartette is faintly heard_. _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_. MRS. MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_,
        _are seated together on a Louis Seize sofa_. _They are types of exquisite fragility_. _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_. _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]</h4>


    <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LORD GORING. _Thirty-four_, _but always says he is younger_. _A well-bred_, _expressionless face_. _He is clever_, _but would not like to be thought so_. _A flawless dandy_, _he would be annoyed if he were considered romantic_. _He plays
        with life_, _and is on perfectly good terms with the world_. _He is fond of being misunderstood_. _It gives him a post of vantage_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name mabelchiltern">MABEL CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Well, I delight in your bad qualities. I wouldn’t have you part with one of them.</p>

    <h6 class="name lordgoring">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech">How very nice of you! But then you are always nice. By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel. Who brought Mrs. Cheveley here? That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the room with your brother?</p>
